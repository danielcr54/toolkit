step 1.) clone this github repository. This repository contains a very basic react application with material ui components.
step 2.) Fix any errors that prevent the project from being built and run.
step 3.) On the main app.js page there is a todo form. You can see this component by clicking the ( M ) button Route this form to it's own page with the endpoint /todo
step 4.) Create a table of todo items. When the user types into the textbox and clicks submit, the ui should have a table of these todo display.
step 5.) On the newly created table, create a delete function that will remove a todo item.
